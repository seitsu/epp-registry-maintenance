RFC9167: Registry Maintenance Notifications for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
=================

## Abstract
This [document] describes an [Extensible Provisioning Protocol] (EPP) extension called "Registry Maintenance Notification", which is used by EPP servers to notify EPP clients and allow EPP clients to query EPP servers regarding maintenance events.

## Status
The author, [Tobias Sattler], raised the idea at the ICANN Registrar Stakeholder Group ([RrSG]) Technical and Operational ([TechOps]) Subcommittee, and they further discussed it in the [CPH TechOps] Group. The document was submitted to the IETF [REGEXT] Working Group and adopted based on those discussions. Therefore, this draft was on Standards Track to become an [RFC].

After refining the draft, it passed the REGEXT Working Group Last Call, and the Chairs submitted it to [IESG] for publishing. It then passed the Area Director's evaluation and was in Last Call at IESG, which was successful. Then it moved to the [RFC Editor Queue] and passed the steps there.
